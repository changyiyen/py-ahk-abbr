                              COFFEE-WARE LICENSE
<changyiyen AT gmail DOT com> created this license as a spin-off of
Poul Henning-Kamp's original beerware license, as the author could not tolerate
alcohol. As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want with
this stuff. If we meet some day and you think this stuff is worth it, you can
buy me a coffee in return.  Chang-Yi Yen
